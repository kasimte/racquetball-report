title: Vary Your Shots
---

I fit in eight games this weekend. I also lost eight. Many were close;
I had my chances, some rallies of my own, and I could even smell a
hint of victory around the corner a few times. But in the end, I was
left brushing off my bruises and searching for feedback.

If I varied my shots, particularly on the serve, perhaps I could have
taken one. I’ve been trying to add some new serves to the repertoire,
and I have a fondness for overusing the latest one, eager to put my
newest toy into practice. But I would probably be better off changing
my position on the serve line more often and switching up the serve
style so my opponent doesn’t know what’s coming.
